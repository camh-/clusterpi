This project is to build a cluster of Raspberry Pi nodes (and other
similar hardware boards) to be managed as a kubernetes cluster.

The initial configuration has two board types:
* Raspberry Pi type B
* Raspberry Pi 2 type B

The Orange Pi Plus will be added when I get one. Plus any other hardware
I get my hands on will be added to the franken-cluster.
